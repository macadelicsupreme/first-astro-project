 # My First Blog Post

Published on: 2024-03-13l

welcome to my _new blog_ about learning astro! here, i will share my learning journey as i build a new website.

## what i've accomplished

1. **installing astro**: first, i created a new astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **making pages**: i then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **making blog posts**: this is my first blog post! i now have astro pages and markdown posts!

## what's next

i will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
